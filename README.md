# E-paper-Display-Based-Shelf-Updation-System

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on designing and implementing a low-power, wireless shelf updation system using E-paper displays. The system enables efficient and reliable shelf label updates through BLE communication, with a BeagleBone Black (BBB) acting as a gateway.

🎯 Project Objectives

1. Enable remote and wireless shelf label updates
2. Optimize power consumption for long-term operation
3. Ensure reliable communication between devices and gateway
4. Provide a scalable architecture for multiple shelf nodes
5. Support future upgrades such as OTA and environment monitoring
